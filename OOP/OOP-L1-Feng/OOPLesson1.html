    <h1>OOP 1</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the first OOP tutorial!</p>
    <h1>The Instance Variables</h1>
    <p>Imagine we have a class, that describe the state of a certain Animal. For instance, its name, if its tired or hungry, and its weight. These things are declared as instance variables. These are put at the top of the class, after the opening line of the class. Instance variables should be private. This is to prevent other classes from making changes that shouldn't be possible. For instance, something may try to multiply the weight of an Animal by 100. This may not make sense. We will talk more about how we can prevent this later.</p>
    <pre class = codeSample>public class Animal{
  //Instance variables go here
  private String name;
  private boolean tired;
  private double weight;
  </pre>
    <p>So far, our class defines fields. They define a section of memory, in which information is to be stored. In general, whenever we use this class, we don't want these fields to be empty. We want to define something in it. To do this, we create a constructor. This constructor will create the Animal. Every Animal is different, so we should give a way to them their own name, and their weight when we create them. We can allow for these changes through parameters. Parameters is information that is given when the constructor is needed</p>
    <pre class = codeSample>
  //Constructor name MUST be the same as the class name
  public Animal(String name, double w){
    name = n;//
    tired = true; // The animal will always start tired
    hungry = true; // The animal will always start hungry
    weight = w;
  }</pre>
    <p>Next, we want our animal to be able to interact with everything around it. For instance, if we feed it food, we want it to not be hungry. Likewise, if it sleeps, we want it to not be tired. We can do this by using methods. Methods define an action to perform.</p>
    <pre class = "codeSample">
  //The first method feed.
  public void feed(String v) {//feeds the animal
    hungry = false;//sets the hungry variable to false, making the animal not hungry
      if (v.equals("vegetables"))//If you chose to feed the animal "vegetables"...
        weight += 2;//The animal's weight increases by 2
      else if (v.equals("meat"))//If you chose to feed the animal "meat"...
        weight += 4;//The animal's weight increases by 4
      else//If you chose to feed the animal anything else...
        weight += 1;//The animal's weight increases by 1
  }

  //Second method
  public void sleep() {//makes the animal sleep
    tired = false;//Sets the tired variable to false, making the animal not tired
    weight -= 3;//The animal's weight decreases by 3
  }</pre>
  <p>Finally, we want to be able to run your program. We can do this by declaring a main method. This method is where you use all of the other methods to create a meaningful result. In this example, we make a few different animals</p>
<pre class = "codeSample">
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      Animal a = new Animal("Cow", 10);
      Animal b = new Animal("Sheep", 10);
      Animal c = new Animal("Hippo", 10);
      Animal d = new Animal("Cat", 10);
      Animal e = new Animal("Goose", 10);
  }
}</pre>
     
 <h2>Your Turn!</h2>
<p>To practise this concept, try to represent a Car, a House, and a Student. To help you, I will provide a template for you to edit:</p>
     <pre class = "codeSample" contenteditable="true">
  public class Car{
    //Create variables for: brand, model, kilometers, gas, tankCapacity

    //Add parameters
    public Car(){
      //Initialize Values
    }

    //Add a distance parameter
    public void drive(){
      //decide what happens when the car drives
    }

    //add gas to the car
    public void gasUp(){
      //fill the tank
    }

    public static void main(String[]args){
      //Create cars!
    }
  }</pre>
  <button onclick = "displayAnswer('car')">Compare</button>
    <iframe class = "answers" id = car src = "OOP\OOP-L1-Feng\Exercise1\Car.java"></iframe>
  <pre class = "codeSample" contenteditable="true">
  public class House{
    //Create the follow variables:    street_num, street name, city name, province name, postal_code, size(decimal number), detached(true or false), stories(number)
    //NOTE: remember encapsulation

    //parameters allow all variables to be set 
    public House(){
      //set variables
    }

    public void displayAddress(){//prints out a formatted house address
      //Print the street number and the street name
      //Print the city and province
      //Print the postal code
    }

    public static void main(String[]args){
      //Test!
    }
  }
  </pre>
  <button onclick = "displayAnswer('house')">Compare</button>
  <iframe class = "answers" id = 'house' src = "OOP\OOP-L1-Feng\Exercise1\House.java"></iframe>

  <pre class="codeSample" contenteditable="true">
  public class Student{
    //Create variables: students name, first and second mark, his average

    //Parameters to set the name
    public Student(){

    }

    //Parameters to set the marks
    public void setMarks(){

    }

    //Calculate average
    public void calcAverage(){

    }

    //Returns a string , containing the name and average of the student
    public String message() {

    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      //Test    
    }
  }
  </pre>

         <h1>Common Interactions With Classes</h1>
    <p>Most of the time, Classes should keep their variables private. As we talked about in Exercise 1, this improves the security of your variables. However, we still want to be able to edit these variables, or else there will be no way to interact with the information in the class. So how do we achieve this?</p>
    <h2>Accessors And Mutators</h2>
    <p>Everyone, including you, makes use of Accessors and Mutators. The screen that is projecting this text to you is an accessor method. It tells other things what it contains. But the computer would be pretty useless if all it could do was display something. We also want to be able to interact with it. We want to edit something, and the outcome be very predictable. A laptop comes with a keyboard, and a track pad, and you can add other peripherals like a mouse to interact with the laptop. These items are mutators. They mutate the data within the object, and thus causes the accessor method do display something different.</p>
  <h1>More Facts!</h1>
     
    <b><u><p>1. Definitions of the following in terms of Objects/classes in Java.</p></u></b>

<p><b>accessor method</b>: A class' accessor method allows another class to read its private variables/fields.</p>

<p><b>explicit parameter</b>: An explicit parameter is part of the parameter list declared in the constructor.</p>

<p><b>null reference</b>: A null reference can be given to any non primitive data type, and indicates that it doesn't reference an object.</p>

<p><b>formal parameter</b>: The parameters inside the parentheses when describing a method.</p>

<p><b>mutator method</b>: A mutator is a set method, and allows for other classes to edit values.</p>

<p><b>String literal</b>: The value within double quotes.</p>

<p><b>pass by value</b>: Passes the actually value and not a reference to the parameter.</p>

<p><b>actual parameter</b>: The parameters inside the parentheses when calling the method.</p>

<p><b>implicit parameter</b>: It is the implicit parameter of the object that is calling it.</p>

<p><b>scope</b>: Represents the time that the variable is "alive".</p>

<p><b>promoting</b>: When working with PDTs of different sizes, java will automatically grow the smallest data type into the larger one.</p>

<p><b>pass by reference</b>: Passes the instance variable and not a value to the parameter.</p>

<b><u><p>2. Explain the relationship between the variable scope and the initialization process.</p></u></b>

<p>The variable scope is the range between its initialization and the end of the code block in which the initialization occured.</p>

<b><u><p>3. Explain what is happening in RAM in each of these lines of code:</p></u></b>

<pre class = codeSample>
String m = "Text 1";
String r = "Text 2";
r = m;
m = null;
</pre>

<p>A new object with the value "Text 1" is stored in the string pool</p>

<p>The String pool is checked for the value "Text 2"</p>

<p>A new object with the value "Text 1" is stored in the string pool</p>

<p>r references m.</p>

<p>m is given a null reference, and no longer refers to the value "Text 1".</p>

<b><u><p>4. Explain the differences between compareTo(), compareToIgnoreCase(), and equals().</p></u></b>

<p>compareTo() and compareToIgnoreCase() both try to order two Strings in alphabetical order. However, compareTo() compares ascii values, and so uppercase values are different from the lower case value of the same letter. To solve this problem, compareToIgnoreCase() converts everything to lowercase before comparing. equals() is different because it returns a boolean value. That value indicates if the two strings have the same value, or if they do not.</p>

<b><u><p>5. The object class - the following methods are required for the AP exam. Define each method in your own words and give your own code examples for each method.</p></u></b>

<p>toString(): The toString() method allows the class to return something, without specifically calling this method. The default toString() method will return information on the object.</p>

<pre class = codeSample>
public class ToStringExample{
  public String toString(){
    return "This is how toString() works!";
  }
  public static void main(String[]args){
    ToStringExample tse = new ToStringExample();
    System.out.println(tse);
  }
}</pre>

<p>OUTPUT: This is how toString() works!</p>

<p>equals(): The equals() method allows for comparison between two classes. The default method will check for the same reference point. You must override for other functions. The String class has an override method.</p>

<pre class = codeSample>
  public static void main(String[]args){
    String m = "This is a String";
    if(m.equals("Hello!"))
      System.out.println("This won’t print");
    else
      System.out.println("This is right. The two strings are not equal");</p>
    //Usage with default equals() function
    RandomClass rc = new RandomClass();
    RandomClass rc1 = rc;
    System.out.println(rc.equals(rc1));//should return true</p>
}</pre>

<p>hashCode(): This method will give you a hash code for the object. The object that return equal from the equals() method would ideally have the same hash. The string method has an override method for equals() and does not simply check for the reference points.</p>
<pre class = codeSample>
public static void main(String[]args){
  String m = "this is a String";
  String r = "this is a String";
  if(m.hashCode() == r.hashCode())
  System.out.println("Yay!");
  //Usage with the default equals() function
  RandomClass rc = new RandomClass();
  RandomClass rc1 = rc;
  System.out.println(rc.hashCode() + " is equal to " + rc1.hashCode());
}
</pre>

<b><u><p>6. Explain class downcasting. List the pros and cons of downcasting as well as any cautions</p></u></b>

<p>Class downcasting is when a Superclass instance variable creates a subclass object</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>Can access superclass methods not included in subclass</p>

<p>Can access subclass overrides, as well as extra subclass methods</p>

<p>Allows for polymorphism</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>Can't use overridden superclass methods</p>

<p>Normally bad programming practise</p>

<p>CAUTIONS</p>

<p>You cannot cast to another subclass</p>

<p>Unless you cast, calling methods that are not in the super class returns an error</p>

<b><u><p>7. Explain class casting. List the pros and cons of casting as well as any cautions.</p></u></b>

<p>Class casting can be used when trying to access extra methods from the subclass when downcasting.</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>allows access to unique subclass methods</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>limited to that specified subclass</p>

<p>CAUTIONS</p>

<p>You cannot cast to a different subclass</p>

<b><u><p>8. Explain PDT casting. List the pros and cons of casting as well as any cautions.</p></u></b>

<p>Primitive data type casting is converting one PDT to another.</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>Allows for easier manipulation of data</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>Casting a larger data type to a smaller one will result in a loss of data</p>

<p>CAUTIONS</p>

<p>Booleans cannot be cannot be casted into another data type, nor can it be casted into by another data type</p>

<b><u><p>9. Explain the difference between static/class and instance/member methods.</p></u></b>

<p>Static methods do not rely on values created with an object. They are consistent throughout all objects, and can even be used without an object. On the other hand, instance methods are object specific. They require an object in order to be run.</p>
