    <h1>Advanced</h1>
    <p>This is the end of the OOP series. This will be a long topic. Here, we will be discussing various high level object oriented programming concepts.</p>

    <h1 id = "polymorphism">Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>The first concept we will talk about is polymorphism. Polymorphism allows for an object to take on many different forms.</p>
    <p>In java, polymorphism allows subclass objects to be assigned to a reference of its superclass. So what does this mean? If you wanted to talk about a bear, what could you say? There are many ways to refer to the bear. We could call it a bear, but we could also classify it by its "superclass", and just say, that "animal". This is completely valid. Something polymorphism doesnt allow for is for an object of the super class to be put in a reference of a subclass. This is the equivilent of calling any animal, "bear". The animal may not necessarily be a bear.</p>
    <p>Now that you understand what polymorphism is, when would you use it?</p>
    <p>My first reason would be that it is easier to use. For instance, imagine you ran a zoo. You want to create a database of all of the different animals you have in your zoo. WIthout polymorphism, every type of animal needs its own array to hold it. This is very inefficient, and it is hard for you to keep track as your zoo continues to add new animals. However, by using polymorphism, and making every animal have an Animal reference, this problem becomes rather trivial. To test if you understand this concept, try to code this below:</p>
    <pre class = "codeSample" contenteditable="true">
Animal[] zooAnimals = new Animal[3];
//Assume that the Animal class has already been coded. The Animal class has a few subclasses: Monkey, Tiger, and Zebra.
//Your task is to create objects of these classes and put them into the zooAnimals array.</pre>
    <button onclick = "displayAnswer('zoo')">Compare</button>
    <iframe class = "answers" id = zoo src = "OOP\Advanced1\Zoo.java"></iframe>
    <h1 id = "programmingDesign">Programming Design</h1>
    <p>The next part is programming design. Having a proper program structure is important, because it allows other people to read your code clearly. One standard way to graphically organize your code is uml. uml stands for Unified Modeling Language. There are many different types of uml diagrams. One of them is the class diagram. This diagram can help describe your classes, and what they do.</p>
    <h1 id = "encapsulation">Encapsulation</h1>
    <p>Encapsulation is a style to follow to ensure security of your data in classes and objects. It would be bad if just anyone could change a variable at will. Imagine playing pong. If the paddle class was not properly encapsulated, a hacker could easily change the position of a the paddle to teleport to new locations. Obviously, this will just be a mild annoyance in a game of pong, and you would quickly find something else to do. However, this is a very important habit to develop, because sometimes, your program may need to handle sensitive information, like passwords, emails, birthdays etc.</p>
    <p>To encapsulate your data, you need to do two things. First, global variables that you would like to ecapsulate must be private. This limits access to these variables to only the class. Now, you can create get and set methods. These methods can define limits, for example, if the paddle tries to move too many pixels, the program won't allow it.</p>
    <h1 id = "abstraction">Abstraction</h1>
    <p>Abstraction allows us to define a simple template. Whenever any method in a class is abstract, the class must be abstract. We can do this by adding the keyword "abstract" before the word class</p>
    <pre class = codeSample><b>abstract</b> class</pre>
    <p>Methods that we want to be defined as abstract will not contain any default instruction</p>
    <pre class = codeSample>abstract [some data type] foo();</pre>
    <p>An abstract class can contain both abstract methods and non-abstract methods. All subclasses <b>MUST</b> provide implementation for the abstract methods. Java also supports something called an interface. All methods in an interface are abstract, and so they do not require the abstract keyword. You cannot extend an interface. You can only implement it, using the "implements" keyword.</p>
    <h1 id = "inheritance">Inheritance</h1>
    <p>Inheritance is a very important OOP concept, and can help save alot of repetitive code. Imagine you wanted to represent all Birds. All birds have some traits that are similar. For example, each bird has a beak, wings, feet, etc. However, each bird may have a different colour beak, wing, and feet. Each bird also does different things, some run, some hop, some fly, others do a combination. To do this, you can create classes that "inherit" properties from the bird. Below is an example of the Bird class.</p>
    <pre class = "codeSample">
public abstract class Bird{
  private String beakColor;
  private String bodyColor;
  private String name;

  public Bird(String beak, String body, String name){
    beakColor = beak;
    bodyColor = body;
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getBeak(){
    return beakColor;
  }

  public String getBody(){
    return bodyColor;
  }

  public String getName(){
    return name;
  }

  abstract void call();

  abstract void action();

}
    </pre>
    <p>Those are some things that all bird will have. Notice how we left the birds call and its actions to be abstract. There is no default bird call, or action, because they could be different. Also notice that there is no default constructor. Again, there is no "default bird", so we cannot generate its colors and name before hand. Now. lets try and create a Great Horned Owl!</p>
    <pre class = "codeSample">
public class GreatHornedOwl extends Bird{//To inherit another class, we need to "extend" it.
  public GreatHornedOwl(){
    super("black", "brown", "Great Horned Owl");
  }

  public void call(){
    System.out.println("hoot!");
  }

  public void action(){
    System.out.println("The " + getName() + " has taken off!");
  }
}
    </pre>
    <p>Now you have seen how inheritance works. It is now your turn to try to create a new bird. Be creative! Make sure the run your program and experiment.</p>
